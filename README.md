# TriviaGame



This is a trivia game which uses radio inputs on an html page. It asks four questions which ask various parts of trivia generally related to science.
It was desgined with some bootstrap and css. The page is also on a timer, and calculates the results of the user via javascript.

There is a bug in this page in that the results only last a few seconds. I am presently trying to figure out how to repair this
